KNIME Business Hub is affected by several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in its web pages. If a user clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious web page, arbitrary Java Script may be executed with this user's permissions. This can lead to information loss and/or modification of existing data.
The issues are caused by a  bug https://github.com/Baroshem/nuxt-security/issues/610  in the widely used nuxt-security module.





There are no viable workarounds therefore we strongly recommend to update to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub:





  *  1.13.3 or later






  *  1.12.4 or later

We observed that Intellispace Portal binaries doesn’t have any protection mechanisms to prevent reverse engineering. Specifically, the app’s code is not obfuscated, and no measures are in place to protect against decompilation, disassembly, or debugging. As a result, attackers can reverse-engineer the application to gain insights into its internal workings, which can potentially lead to the discovery of sensitive information, business logic flaws, and other vulnerabilities.
Utilizing this flaw, the attacker was able to identify the Hardcoded credentials from PortalUsersDatabase.dll, which contains .NET remoting definition. Inside the namespace PortalUsersDatabase, the class Users contains the functions CreateAdmin and CreateService that are used to initialize accounts in the Portal service. Both CreateAdmin and CreateService functions contain a hardcoded encrypted password along with its respective salt that are set with the function SetInitialPasswordAndSalt.
This issue affects IntelliSpace Portal: 12 and prior; Advanced Visualization Workspace: 15.

zincati is an auto-update agent for fedora coreos hosts. zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy` to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to reboot the system into the deployed update. since zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. in practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system d-bus socket is able to deploy older fedora coreos versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. this primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system d-bus socket. note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. by default, containers do not have access to the system d-bus socket. the logic error is fixed in zincati v0.0.30. a workaround is to manually add a following polkit rule, instructions for which are available in the github security advisory.

notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.
After retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature. During the timestamp signature generation, the revocation status of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp signature generation, notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised, intermediate, or revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature, which would then be accepted and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service scenarios, particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Harden loops for looking up ALH copiers

Other, non DAI copier widgets could have the same  stream name (sname) as
the ALH copier and in that case the copier->data is NULL, no alh_data is
attached, which could lead to NULL pointer dereference.
We could check for this NULL pointer in sof_ipc4_prepare_copier_module()
and avoid the crash, but a similar loop in sof_ipc4_widget_setup_comp_dai()
will miscalculate the ALH device count, causing broken audio.

The correct fix is to harden the matching logic by making sure that the
1. widget is a DAI widget - so dai = w->private is valid
2. the dai (and thus the copier) is ALH copier

Simply replace skb_get() by skb_clone() in net/llc/llc_s_ac.c

Note that e1000 driver might have an issue with pktgen,
because it does not clear IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING, this is an
orthogonal change.

Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. Versions before 10.10.7 are vulnerable to argument injection in FFmpeg. This can be leveraged to possibly achieve remote code execution by anyone with credentials to a low-privileged user. This vulnerability was previously reported in CVE-2023-49096 and patched in version 10.8.13, but the patch can be bypassed. The original fix sanitizes some parameters to make injection impossible, but certain unsanitized parameters can still be used for argument injection. The same unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable: /Videos/<itemId>/stream and /Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>, likely alongside similar endpoints in AudioController. This argument injection can be exploited to achieve arbitrary file write, leading to possible remote code execution through the plugin system. While the unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable, a valid itemId is required for exploitation and any authenticated attacker could easily retrieve a valid itemId to make the exploit work. This vulnerability is patched in version 10.10.7.

ghosts is an open source user simulation framework for cyber experimentation, simulation, training, and exercise. a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in ghosts version 8.0.0.0 that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo retrieval endpoint. the vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint, which is designed to serve profile photos for npcs (non-player characters) but fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths. when an npc is created with a specially crafted photolink value containing path traversal sequences (../, ..\, etc.), the application processes these sequences without proper sanitization. this allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files outside of the intended photo directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files. the vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process, which could include configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data. this issue has been addressed in version 8.2.7.90 and all users are advised to upgrade. there are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Add a AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC_RANGES macro to
expand to AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0

For DCDC4, steps is 100mv

Add a AXP_DESC_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC macro to
expand to AXP_DESC_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0

This patch fix crashes when using CPU DVFS.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/zswap: fix inconsistency when zswap_store_page() fails

Commit b7c0ccdfbafd ("mm: zswap: support large folios in zswap_store()")
skips charging any zswap entries when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

However, when some base pages are zswapped but it failed to zswap the
entire folio, the zswap operation is rolled back.  When freeing zswap
entries for those pages, zswap_entry_free() uncharges the zswap entries
that were not previously charged, causing zswap charging to become
inconsistent.

This inconsistency triggers two warnings with following steps:
  # On a machine with 64GiB of RAM and 36GiB of zswap
  $ stress-ng --bigheap 2 # wait until the OOM-killer kills stress-ng
  $ sudo reboot

  The two warnings are:
    in mm/memcontrol.c:163, function obj_cgroup_release():
      WARN_ON_ONCE(nr_bytes & (PAGE_SIZE - 1));

    in mm/page_counter.c:60, function page_counter_cancel():
      if (WARN_ONCE(new < 0, "page_counter underflow: %ld nr_pages=%lu\n",
	  new, nr_pages))

zswap_stored_pages also becomes inconsistent in the same way.

As suggested by Kanchana, increment zswap_stored_pages and charge zswap
entries within zswap_store_page() when it succeeds.  This way,
zswap_entry_free() will decrement the counter and uncharge the entries
when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

While this could potentially be optimized by batching objcg charging and
incrementing the counter, let's focus on fixing the bug this time and
leave the optimization for later after some evaluation.

After resolving the inconsistency, the warnings disappear.

better auth is an authentication and authorization library for typescript. prior to version 1.1.21, the application is vulnerable to an open redirect due to improper validation of the callbackurl parameter in the email verification endpoint and any other endpoint that accepts callback url. while the server blocks fully qualified urls, it incorrectly allows scheme-less urls. this results in the browser interpreting the url as a fully qualified url, leading to unintended redirection. an attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious verification link and tricking users into clicking it. upon successful email verification, the user will be automatically redirected to the attacker's website, which can be used for phishing, malware distribution, or stealing sensitive authentication tokens. this cve is a bypass of the fix for ghsa-8jhw-6pjj-8723/cve-2024-56734. version 1.1.21 contains an updated patch.

mobile security framework (mobsf) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (android/ios/windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework. according to apple's documentation for bundle id's, it must contain only alphanumeric characters (a&#8211;z, a&#8211;z, and 0&#8211;9), hyphens (-), and periods (.). however, an attacker can manually modify this value in the `info.plist` file and add special characters to the `<key>cfbundleidentifier</key>` value. when the application parses the wrong characters in the bundle id, it encounters an error. as a result, it will not display content and will throw a 500 error instead. the only way to make the pages work again is to manually remove the malicious application from the system. this issue has been addressed in version 4.3.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. there are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

The <redacted>.exe or <redacted>.exe CGI binary can be used to upload arbitrary files to /tmp/upload/ or /tmp/ respectively as any user, although the user interface for uploading files is only shown to the iocadmin user.

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.

Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will need to have knowledge of this CGI binary, e.g. by finding it in firmware. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the <redacted>.exe or <redacted>.exe CGI binary and upload the file, or convince a user with such access to upload it.

Impact: Low – The attacker can upload arbitrary files to /tmp/upload/ or /tmp/. However, the attacker is unable to access or use these files without other vulnerabilities.

CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). Artitrary files can be uploaded, be these files will not be in a location where they can influence confidentiality or availability and have a minimal impact on device integrity (VC:N/VI:L/VA:N).  There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). While this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, we do not expect this vulnerability to have a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y).

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/secretmem: fix panic when growing a memfd_secret

When one tries to grow an existing memfd_secret with ftruncate, one gets
a panic [1].  For example, doing the following reliably induces the
panic:

    fd = memfd_secret();

    ftruncate(fd, 10);
    ptr = mmap(NULL, 10, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    strcpy(ptr, "123456789");

    munmap(ptr, 10);
    ftruncate(fd, 20);

The basic reason for this is, when we grow with ftruncate, we call down
into simple_setattr, and then truncate_inode_pages_range, and eventually
we try to zero part of the memory.  The normal truncation code does this
via the direct map (i.e., it calls page_address() and hands that to
memset()).

For memfd_secret though, we specifically don't map our pages via the
direct map (i.e.  we call set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() on every
fault).  So the address returned by page_address() isn't useful, and
when we try to memset() with it we panic.

This patch avoids the panic by implementing a custom setattr for
memfd_secret, which detects resizes specifically (setting the size for
the first time works just fine, since there are no existing pages to try
to zero), and rejects them with EINVAL.

One could argue growing should be supported, but I think that will
require a significantly more lengthy change.  So, I propose a minimal
fix for the benefit of stable kernels, and then perhaps to extend
memfd_secret to support growing in a separate patch.

usbnet: ipheth: use static NDP16 location in URB

Original code allowed for the start of NDP16 to be anywhere within the
URB based on the `wNdpIndex` value in NTH16. Only the start position of
NDP16 was checked, so it was possible for even the fixed-length part
of NDP16 to extend past the end of URB, leading to an out-of-bounds
read.

On iOS devices, the NDP16 header always directly follows NTH16. Rely on
and check for this specific format.

This, along with NCM-specific minimal URB length check that already
exists, will ensure that the fixed-length part of NDP16 plus a set
amount of DPEs fit within the URB.

Note that this commit alone does not fully address the OoB read.
The limit on the amount of DPEs needs to be enforced separately.

MinIO is a high performance object storage. Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to 
RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the client's key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups). Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

seccomp: passthrough uretprobe systemcall without filtering

When attaching uretprobes to processes running inside docker, the attached
process is segfaulted when encountering the retprobe.

The reason is that now that uretprobe is a system call the default seccomp
filters in docker block it as they only allow a specific set of known
syscalls. This is true for other userspace applications which use seccomp
to control their syscall surface.

Since uretprobe is a "kernel implementation detail" system call which is
not used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical and
there's very little point in forcing all userspace applications to
explicitly allow it in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.

Pass this systemcall through seccomp without depending on configuration.

Note: uretprobe is currently only x86_64 and isn't expected to ever be
supported in i386.

If dev_set_name() fails, we leak nvmem->wp_gpio as the cleanup does not
put this. While a minimal fix for this would be to add the gpiod_put()

This results in a slightly larger fix, but results in clear code.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix pointer-leak due to insufficient speculative store bypass mitigation

To mitigate Spectre v4, 2039f26f3aca ("bpf: Fix leakage due to
insufficient speculative store bypass mitigation") inserts lfence
instructions after 1) initializing a stack slot and 2) spilling a
pointer to the stack.

However, this does not cover cases where a stack slot is first
initialized with a pointer (subject to sanitization) but then
overwritten with a scalar (not subject to sanitization because
the slot was already initialized). In this case, the second write
may be subject to speculative store bypass (SSB) creating a
speculative pointer-as-scalar type confusion. This allows the
program to subsequently leak the numerical pointer value using,
for example, a branch-based cache side channel.

To fix this, also sanitize scalars if they write a stack slot
that previously contained a pointer. Assuming that pointer-spills
are only generated by LLVM on register-pressure, the performance
impact on most real-world BPF programs should be small.

The following unprivileged BPF bytecode drafts a minimal exploit
and the mitigation:

  [...]
  // r6 = 0 or 1 (skalar, unknown user input)
  // r7 = accessible ptr for side channel
  // r10 = frame pointer (fp), to be leaked
  //
  r9 = r10 # fp alias to encourage ssb
  *(u64 *)(r9 - 8) = r10 // fp[-8] = ptr, to be leaked
  // lfence added here because of pointer spill to stack.
  //
  // Ommitted: Dummy bpf_ringbuf_output() here to train alias predictor
  // for no r9-r10 dependency.
  //
  *(u64 *)(r10 - 8) = r6 // fp[-8] = scalar, overwrites ptr
  // 2039f26f3aca: no lfence added because stack slot was not STACK_INVALID,
  // store may be subject to SSB
  //
  // fix: also add an lfence when the slot contained a ptr
  //
  r8 = *(u64 *)(r9 - 8)
  // r8 = architecturally a scalar, speculatively a ptr
  //
  // leak ptr using branch-based cache side channel:
  r8 &= 1 // choose bit to leak
  if r8 == 0 goto SLOW // no mispredict
  // architecturally dead code if input r6 is 0,
  // only executes speculatively iff ptr bit is 1
  r8 = *(u64 *)(r7 + 0) # encode bit in cache (0: slow, 1: fast)
SLOW:
  [...]

After running this, the program can time the access to *(r7 + 0) to
determine whether the chosen pointer bit was 0 or 1. Repeat this 64
times to recover the whole address on amd64.

In summary, sanitization can only be skipped if one scalar is
overwritten with another scalar. Scalar-confusion due to speculative
store bypass can not lead to invalid accesses because the pointer
bounds deducted during verification are enforced using branchless
logic. See 979d63d50c0c ("bpf: prevent out of bounds speculation on
pointer arithmetic") for details.

Do not make the mitigation depend on !env->allow_{uninit_stack,ptr_leaks}
because speculative leaks are likely unexpected if these were enabled.
For example, leaking the address to a protected log file may be acceptable
while disabling the mitigation might unintentionally leak the address
into the cached-state of a map that is accessible to unprivileged
processes.

Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for applications via a web portal. If users are allowed to sign in via both username and email the regulation system treats these as separate login events. This leads to the regulation limitations being effectively doubled assuming an attacker using brute-force to find a user password. It's important to note that due to the effective operation of regulation where no user-facing sign of their regulation ban being visible either via timing or via API responses, it's effectively impossible to determine if a failure occurs due to a bad username password combination, or a effective ban blocking the attempt which heavily mitigates any form of brute-force. This occurs because the records and counting process for this system uses the method utilized for sign in rather than the effective username attribute. This has a minimal impact on account security, this impact is increased naturally in scenarios when there is no two-factor authentication required and weak passwords are used. This makes it a bit easier to brute-force a password. A patch for this issue has been applied to versions 4.38.19, and 4.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should 1. Not heavily modify the default settings in a way that ends up with shorter or less frequent regulation bans. The default settings effectively mitigate any potential for this issue to be exploited. and 2. Disable the ability for users to login via an email address.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: state: fix out-of-bounds read during lookup

lookup and resize can run in parallel.

The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry, but the hash
functions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist
array.

rehash does:
  rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst, ndst) [..]
  net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask;

While state lookup does:
  h = xfrm_dst_hash(net, daddr, saddr, tmpl->reqid, encap_family);
  hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x, net->xfrm.state_bydst + h, bydst) {

This is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than
net->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets
serialized via state spinlock again).

Fix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers.
The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer
and the hmask will be consistent.

The existing helpers, like xfrm_dst_hash(), are now unsafe for RCU side,
add lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for insert
side.

xfrm_state_lookup_byaddr() uses the spinlock rather than RCU.
AFAICS this is an oversight from back when state lookup was converted to
RCU, this lock should be replaced with RCU in a future patch.
